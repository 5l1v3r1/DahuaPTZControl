# DahuaPTZControl

A .NET application which can be used as an "External script" to enable control of Dahua SD6xxx PTZ cameras using the Blue Iris interface.

NOTE: Blue Iris now supports Dahua h.264 PTZ camera natively.

The application can optionally trigger the camera in Blue Iris a configurable number of seconds after calling a preset.
